Military press,"The military press is a compound movement used to build size and strength in the shoulders. It was once contested as a fourth powerlift, but is rarely competed anymore. However, being able to press a significant weight overhead remains a popular marker of upper-body strength. The military press can be trained as a strength lift or in traditional muscle-building rep ranges as part of full-body, shoulder-focused, or upper-body training."
Dumbbell front raise,"The dumbbell front raise is a fundamental weight training exercise that is great for beginning trainers. In this version of the dumbbell front raise, you start with a dumbbell in each hand at thigh level. You raise the dumbbells parallel to the floor and then return to the starting position to complete one exercise repetition. You can use this exercise in an upper body workout to build your shoulder strength."
